## Governance Principles

1. Human Sovereignty — Final authority remains with Mr Parivar  
2. Separation of Powers — Governance does not execute  
3. Traceability — All actions traceable to canonical source  
4. Non-Autonomy — Governance observes and constrains  
5. Versioned Integrity — Public versioning and supersession

---

## Core Mandates

- Define authority boundaries for AI systems  
- Supervise AGI Guardian as observer layer  
- Maintain ethical and decision integrity  
- Establish canonical chain of proof  
- Preserve legacy conceptual registries

---

## Canonical Relationship

AGI Guardian operates as a non-executive conceptual layer within this governance framework.  
Governance authority remains external and superordinate.
